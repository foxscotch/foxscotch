### Hobbies

I do a lot of watching series on Netflix. Pretty much whatever sounds good. As
of writing, I've just finished rewatching Sense8 for the first time in a few
years. Highly recommended. Before that was The Magicians, which I feel more
conflicted about, but on the whole I think it's alright.

I'm big into watching random YouTube videos. Have to admit it's mostly nonsense
that I click on. But I do like more thoughtful content as well. [CinemaWins][cw]
is great, I love [Philosophy Tube][pt] and [Pop Culture Detective][pcd]'s
videos, and I literally can't recommend [Jacob Geller][jg] enough. If you need a
specific recommendation, [The Golem and the Jewish Superhero][golem] is really
good. But honestly, click on any video of his, and you'll be in for a treat.

Also really like movies. Some recent favorites include Everything Everywhere All
at Once, Nope, Across the Spider-Verse, and Dune (2022). Some wonderful
not-as-recent (but still kinda recent) examples are Arrival, Annihilation (the
book, too), and, well, Into the Spider-Verse. I adore the Legendary monsterverse
franchise, i.e. the one that started with Godzilla (2014).

And music!! I genuinely don't even know where to start when it comes to my
favorite music. I'll have to really sit down and come up with a few
recommendations because there is literally so much good music out there and I
listen to a lot of it.

I love science fiction, when I read (usually with audiobooks, so not exactly
_reading_), it's gonna be scifi almost every time. I'm also into writing it!
Nothing public yet, but maybe I'll have some short stories or something I can
link to soon. In 2023 I took my first shot at NaNoWriMo (which is ongoing as of
writing this), and I'm hoping to continue writing after the month is over, as
well as participate in future years!

### More Contact Info

Here's a few more places to find me, which I didn't feel were needed on the main
readme:

- Twitter - [@foxscotch](https://twitter.com/Foxscotch)
- Cohost - [@foxscotch](https://cohost.org/foxscotch)
- FurAffinity - [foxscotch](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/foxscotch)
- Steam - [foxscotch][steam] (hmu if you wanna play Apex)

I'll probably make a fediverse account sometime. But nothing yet.

### \*Languages

I mentioned "several other languages" in the main document, so in the interest
of being complete, here is the list (at least the ones I remember), again in
order from most experienced to least:

- JavaScript (+ TypeScript, which I actually strongly prefer to use)
- Python
- Ruby
- C#
- Lua (also YueScript, which is a little nicer to look at)
- C
- Java
- Elixir
- Haskell
- PHP

If I find the time, I'd really like to learn more of Haskell and Elixir. I'm
also planning to start looking into Rust in the near future. It seems neat.

Frameworks are kind of related to languages, so here's a few of those I like
too. Also game engines and stuff like that cus why not. The ordering is more
arbitrary for this one, but you could consider it to be sorted roughly by how
much I like them. But I'm only including stuff I like to begin with! So don't
think I dislike something just cus it's lower.
