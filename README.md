Hi! I'm Foxscotch, a full-stack web developer mainly, but I do other stuff
sometimes. Currently working for a fintech company, doing Ruby on Rails
development. I have a slight preference for frontend, but much of the stuff I've
done in the past has been just me, and my job is full-stack, so I'm pretty cool
with either side. If your backend stack includes something cool like Elixir I
might even prefer it.

I'm most experienced with JavaScript (front and back), Python, Ruby (incl.
Rails), and C#, in that order. I've spent time with several other
languages[\*](MORE.md#languages) too, and I love learning new ones, so I'm open
to pretty much anything!

I live in east Alabama, which is also where I grew up. I'm accustomed to remote
work (current employer is all the way over in California!), although I'd
probably prefer in-office work, if it's an option and the commute is reasonable.
I'm just a little more productive that way.

### Where to find me

I'm usually @foxscotch everywhere, but here's a few links anyway:

- Personal site - [foxscot.ch], source: [foxscotch/foxscot-ch][foxscot.ch-repo]
- Telegram - [@foxscotch](https://t.me/foxscotch) (preferred contact, but you
  can also email me at the address on my profile)
- Tumblr - [foxscotch](https://foxscotch.tumblr.com/)
- Bluesky - [@foxscot.ch](https://bsky.app/profile/foxscot.ch)

[foxscot.ch]: https://foxscot.ch
[foxscot.ch-repo]: https://github.com/foxscotch/foxscot-ch

On the social sites, I pretty much just reblog/retweet/whatever furry art. So
don't expect much else! But you can count on finding some great stuff if you do
check it out. They're sorted roughly by how often I actually use them.

### Further Reading

In the interest of not cluttering up my profile, I added a second file with a
little more info, if you're curious: [MORE.md](MORE.md)
